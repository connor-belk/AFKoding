- 👋 Hi, I’m @AFKoding
- 👀 I’m interested in all things coding. I focus on what can be done in Python and how far I can stretch it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything Python and hopefully, more expansive projects in the future.
- 📫 How to reach me? Just shoot me an email.
