- 👋 Hi, I’m @AFKoding
- 👀 I’m interested in all things coding. I focus on what can be done in Python and how far I can stretch it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python, JavaScript, HTML, C#, and C++.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything Python and hopefully, more expansive projects in the future.
- 📫 How to reach me? Well, you can just shoot me an email, I guess.
